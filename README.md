# streamlit-30day
A repo to practice using streamlit to visualize web application in Python 

### Day 1
- Set up the environment with Miniconda . Link: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

```bash
conda create -n stenv python=3.11
conda activate stenv
pip install streamlit
streamlit hello
```

### Day 2
- Run first streamlit application
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
### Day 3
Display the button widget with st.button

### Day 4
Work with Ken Jee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk-unX4KnV4
### Day 5
st.write
st.write allows writing text and arguments to the Streamlit app.

In addition to being able to display text, the following can also be displayed via the st.write() command:

Prints strings; works like st.markdown()
Displays a Python dict
Displays pandas DataFrame can be displayed as a table
Plots/graphs/figures from matplotlib, plotly, altair, graphviz, bokeh

### Day 6
Upload source code to GitHub (already had this repo)
### Day 7
Deploying your Streamlit app with Streamlit Community Cloud
- Sign in Github

- Pick a repo, branch and file | click 

### Day 8
Using St.slider allows the display of a slider input widget

A simple app that shows the various ways on how to accept user input by adjusting the slider widget. Flow of the app:

User selects value by adjusting the slider widget

App prints out the selected value
```python
st.select_slider(label, options=(), value=None, format_func=special_internal_function, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")
```

### Day 9
st.line_chart displays a line chart.


A simple app for displaying line chart
Flow of the app:

Create a Pandas DataFrame from numbers randomly generated via NumPy.
Create and display the line chart via st.line_chart() command.

### Day 10
st.selectbox allows the display off a select widget 
a simple app that asks the user what their favorite color is

Flow of the app:

User selects a color.
App prints out the selected color.

### Day 11
st.multiselect displays a multiselect widget.

### Day 12
st.checkbox displays a checkbox widget
For the toggle switch
```python
pip install streamlit-toggle-switch

import  streamlit_toggle as tog
```

### Day 13
Spin up a cloud development environment
GitPod: 
To spin up a development environment on the cloud, we can use GitPod and this can be done simply by clicking on the following link:

### Day 14
Streamlit Components

```bash
pip install streamlit_pandas_profiling
```

### Day 15
st.latex display mathematical expressions formatted as LaTeX.

```python
import streamlit as st

st.header('st.latex')

st.latex(r'''
     a + ar + a r^2 + a r^3 + \cdots + a r^{n-1} =
     \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k =
     a \left(\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}\right)
     ''')
```

### Day 16 
Customizing the theme of Streamlit apps .
Customizing the hex code inside the .streamlit/config.html file 

### Day 17 
st.secrets allows you to store confidential information such as API keys, db passwords or other credentials.

### Day 18
st.file_uploader displays a file uploader widget

By default, uploaded files are limited to 200MB. You can configure this using the server.maxUploadSize config option

### Day 19
Layout Streamlit app

st.set_page_config(layout="wide") - Displays the contents of the app in wide mode (otherwise by default, the contents are encapsulated in a fixed width box.)

st.sidebar - Places the widgets or text/image displays in the sidebar.

st.expander - Places text/image displays inside a collapsible container box.

st.columns - Creates a tabular space (or column) within which contents can be placed inside.

### Day 20
Download the insight face API
```bash   
pip install insightface
```
### Day 21
st.progress displays a progress bar that updates graphically as the iteration progresses 
### Day 22
st.form creates a form that batches elements together with a Submit button
- An user interacts with a widget , the Streamlit app is rerun.
To add elements to a form object, you can use the with notation (preferred) or you could use it as an object notation by just calling methods directly on the form (by first assigning it to a variable and subsequently applying Streamlit methods on it). See in the example app.

Forms have a few constraints:

Every form must contain a st.form_submit_button.
st.button and st.download_button cannot be added to a form.
Forms can appear anywhere in your app (sidebar, columns, etc), but they cannot be embedded inside other forms.

### Day 23
st.experimental_get_query_params
st.experimental_get_query_params allows the retrieval of query parameters directly from the URL of the user's browser.

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title('st.experimental_get_query_params')

with st.expander('About this app'):
  st.write("`st.experimental_get_query_params` allows the retrieval of query parameters directly from the URL of the user's browser.")

# 1. Instructions
st.header('1. Instructions')
st.markdown('''
In the above URL bar of your internet browser, append the following:
`?firstname=Jack&surname=Beanstalk`
after the base URL `http://share.streamlit.io/dataprofessor/st.experimental_get_query_params/`
such that it becomes 
`http://share.streamlit.io/dataprofessor/st.experimental_get_query_params/?firstname=Jack&surname=Beanstalk`
''')


# 2. Contents of st.experimental_get_query_params
st.header('2. Contents of st.experimental_get_query_params')
st.write(st.experimental_get_query_params())


# 3. Retrieving and displaying information from the URL
st.header('3. Retrieving and displaying information from the URL')

firstname = st.experimental_get_query_params()['firstname'][0]
surname = st.experimental_get_query_params()['surname'][0]

st.write(f'Hello **{firstname} {surname}**, how are you?')
```
